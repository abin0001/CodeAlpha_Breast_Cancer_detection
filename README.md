## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This machine learning model aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) based on various features such as mean area, mean perimeter, worst area, and more.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following libraries and tools installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn


## Data Collection

The breast cancer dataset is loaded from a CSV file. The dataset contains information about various features of breast cancer tumors, along with the diagnosis.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include checking for null values and handling them, visualizing correlations among features, and performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to select relevant features.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is performed to identify the most important features for the model. Random Forest is used to calculate feature importance scores.

## Model Training

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the selected features to predict breast cancer diagnosis. The model is evaluated on both training and testing data.

## Results

The accuracy of the model on the training and testing datasets is calculated to assess its performance in breast cancer diagnosis.
